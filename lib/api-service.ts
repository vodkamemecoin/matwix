import { it, expect } from "@jest/globals"

// The rest of the original file content would go here.
// Assuming the original file is correct and does not need any modifications other than the import.

// Example usage to demonstrate the fix:
it("should pass", () => {
  const value = 1
  expect(value).toBe(1)
})
