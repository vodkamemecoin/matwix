// Since the original file was left out for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the file contains tests or assertions that use 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and'.
// I will add a minimal import from a testing library like 'jest' or 'chai' to resolve the undeclared variables.
// If the file is not a test file, then these variables are likely errors and should be addressed differently.
// For this example, I'll assume it's a test file and import from 'jest'.

import { it, expect } from "@jest/globals"

// The rest of the original file content would go here.
// Assuming the original file is correct and does not need any modifications other than the import.

// Example usage to demonstrate the fix:
it("should pass", () => {
  const value = 1
  expect(value).toBe(1)
})
