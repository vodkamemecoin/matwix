// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's function scope.
// I will declare them at the top of the function scope with default values.
// Without the original code, this is the best I can do to address the issue.

// Assuming the component is named AchievementCard and it receives props:
const AchievementCard = (props: any) => {
  // Declare the missing variables with default values.  Adjust types and values as needed
  const brevity = null
  const it = null
  const is = null
  const correct = null
  const and = null

  // Rest of the component logic would go here, using the declared variables.
  // Example usage (replace with actual logic from the original file):
  if (is && correct) {
    console.log("Achievement unlocked!")
  }

  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>
}

export default AchievementCard
