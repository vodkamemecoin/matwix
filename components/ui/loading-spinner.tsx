// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading-spinner.tsx file contains code that uses variables named
// brevity, it, is, correct, and and without declaring or importing them.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution that declares these variables.
// A more accurate solution would require the original code to understand the intended use of these variables.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null
const it = null
const is = null
const correct = null
const and = null

// Replace this comment with the actual content of loading-spinner.tsx
// For example:
// function LoadingSpinner() {
//   return (
//     <div>
//       {is ? "Loading..." : "Not Loading"}
//     </div>
//   );
// }

// export default LoadingSpinner;

// This is a placeholder.  The actual implementation of the loading spinner
// and the use of the declared variables would go here.
